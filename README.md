# CueLineReaderOPSFest
This repository contains downloadable application to be used for practicing lines for Original Practice Shakespeare Festival formatted cue-scripts.

Currently there is only the Mac version available of the executable application.  However, downloading the cueLineReader.py allows the code to be run on linux as well (simply run it as a python3 script).  You may need to import the modules used if you do not already have them (or install python3 if you don't have that).

I have not been able to test the script yet on a Windows computer.  I believe it will work but you would have to change the code on line 174 of cueLineReader.py to call the built-in text to voice system call on windows.
