# CueLineReaderOPSFest
This repository contains downloadable application to be used for practicing lines for Original Practice Shakespeare Festival formatted cue-scripts.

There is a mac and windows version.  Also, downloading the cueLineReader.py allows the code to be run on linux as well (simply run it as a python3 script).  You may need to import the modules used if you do not already have them (or install python3 if you don't have that).

I have not been able to test the script yet on a Windows computer.  I believe it will work
